# Eliza
Eliza, the original computer therapist (not certified). I've re-written this program but kept the core phrases the same. 


However, the key difference is that Eliza speaks to the user. Yes, "she" now has a voice! Furthermore, the option exists for the user to interact with Eliza via microphone. Eliza will hear what you say and respond in turn.

his was written for (and on only tested on linux) so if you're using this on windows or mac it may not run by default. Nor should it run by default on a linux system, for more information on this please see the commented section "Requirements" at the bottom of the source code.
